# My blog

Hello there. This is the source for my blog. It is a small website built with
Jekyll. You are welcome to re-use the CSS; it is MIT licensed. All I ask is
that you remove all references to me from it, including:

* My name
* My social links
* My writing (all posts and pages)
* My Google Analytics tag
* My GoatCounter tag

Thanks.

## Changes Made
Added lastfm-recent.js in assets/js
added lastfm.css in assets/css
added activity.md to make a separate page for showing last.fm etc

> We can use navbar.md in _includes to add/modify pages.
